## Help

##### Can I use my own IDE to develop the project during the course ?
Yes, feel free to use your own IDE for the course.

##### How do I check my Node version ?
To check your current Node.js version, open your terminal and type the command below and you should see your current Node.js version.

```
node -v
```

##### How do I install Node.js LTS version on my machine ?
If you do not have the Node.js LTS version on your machine, you can download using either of the following:
1. Please go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the LTS version of Node.js installable file for your operating system.

2. Alternatively, you can use Node Version Manager (`nvm`) to install LTS version of Node.js
 if you do not want to delete the existing Node.js version on your machine and would like to install LTS `Node.js` version
 Additionally, `NVM` allows you to use multiple Node versions on your machine and it would prevent disrupting other 
 projects you may be running with different `Node.js` versions. Please refer below on how to install Node using NVM.
 
##### How do I use nvm to install Node.js ?
Click on [this link](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and follow the instructions provided in their README.md file 
to install nvm on your machine depending on your platform.

##### Should I install npm separately ?
No, `npm` comes with `Node.js` 
No matter what approach you use to install Node.js, npm will always come with it.

##### How do I check my npm version ?
Open your terminal and type the command below to get your npm version.

```
npm -v
```

##### What version of npm comes with LTS version of Node.js ?
Click on [this click](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the `npm` version should be mentioned under the title _**Downloads**_. 
You must ensure that the npm version and node version should match with what is mentioned on this official page.
